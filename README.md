# Aloha Tune
Aloha Tuner is a simple and user-friendly web application for tuning Ukuleles. I started this project because I couldnâ€™t find a web-based Ukulele Tuner that was also a PWA. I also wanted something with a touch of Hawaiian-inspired design, while being clean, straightforward, and free of unnecessary clutter. 

This project is still a work in progress and serves as a way for me to grow my skills in software development while combining my interests in music and design.

## What the App Does

- Auto Tuner: Detects the pitch of a plucked string through the microphone and provides feedback (e.g., "Too High", "Too Low", or "Perfect").
- Manual Tuner: Plays reference tones so you can tune by ear.
- Light and Dark Modes: A simple toggle to switch between themes.
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile.
- Support for different tunings (e.g., Low G, Baritone).

## Technologies

The app is built with:
- React for building the user interface.
- SCSS for styling with variables and reusable components.
- Tone.js for audio generation and pitch detection.
- Vite for development and build performance.
